SARNEG utils
============

SARNEG - Search And Rescue Numerical Encryption Grid - is simple substition cipher.

We have key of ten characters. Each character is assigned to number from 0 to 9. We then use these characters to encrypt numerical strings.

We use SARNEG to encrypt numerical part of MGRS coordinates.

This is collection of utils to work with SARNEG encryption.
